Privacy Policy for Causeway SmartCommute
Last Updated: June 28, 2025

This Privacy Policy explains how I, the solo developer of Causeway SmartCommute ("the App"), handle your information. My goal is to be transparent while providing a powerful service to help you with your commute.

1. What Information Is Collected?
To make the app work, I need to collect a small amount of data. I've designed the app to be as privacy-respecting as possible.

Anonymous Traffic & Location Data: The app collects anonymized data from public traffic cameras and may use anonymous location data to power the heatmaps and AI forecasting engine. This data is aggregated and is never tied to your personal identity.

Community Reports: When you submit a traffic report (e.g., "Heavy Jam") or vote on an existing one, your anonymous vote is used to inform the community. No personal information is attached to your report.

Device & Ad Identifiers (Optional): If you choose to enable personalized ads, the app uses your device's advertising identifier (like Google's GAID or Apple's IDFA) to show you more relevant ads. This is handled securely through Google's AdMob service. This setting is optional and can be disabled at any time in the app's settings.

Anonymous Analytics: The app uses standard analytics services (like Firebase Analytics) to understand how users interact with the app, identify crashes, and find areas for improvement. All of this data is anonymized and aggregated.

2. How Is Your Information Used?
Your data is used exclusively for the following purposes:

To operate, maintain, and improve the App's core features.

To train the AI models that provide traffic forecasts.

To serve non-personalized or personalized ads, which generate the revenue needed to cover server costs, API fees, and future development.

To diagnose and fix bugs, crashes, and performance issues.

3. Data Sharing and Third Parties
I do not sell your personal data to anyone. Anonymized data may be shared with these third-party services to make the app function:

Google AdMob: To serve advertisements. You can review their privacy policy for more information on how they handle data.

Google Firebase: For backend services like crash reporting, analytics, and database functions.

4. Your Choices and Rights
You are in control of your data.

Opt-Out of Personalized Ads: You can enable or disable personalized ad tracking at any time from the app's settings menu. If you opt out, you will still see ads, but they will not be based on your activity.

Contact Me: If you have any questions or concerns about your privacy, please feel free to contact me.

5. Data Security
I am committed to protecting your data. I use industry-standard security measures provided by services like Google Firebase to safeguard the information collected and stored by the app.

7. Changes to This Policy
