SGJB Jam (“**the App**”) respects your privacy.  
This page explains **what data we collect, why, and how you can control it**.

### 1. Data We Collect

| Category | Details | Purpose |
|----------|---------|---------|
| **Location (precise & coarse)** | GPS coordinates while the app is open. | Compute live jam heat-maps & AI forecasts. |
| **Device ID (Advertising Identifier \*\***\*) | Used **only** if you opt-in to tracking via Apple’s ATT prompt. | Serve personalised ads & measure installs. |
| **Firebase UID** | Random ID created at sign-up. | Link forum posts & favourites to your account. |
| **Crash & usage logs** | Aggregate events (screens visited, errors). | Improve app stability & features. |

\* You can disable personalised ads any time: **Settings › Privacy › Tracking** on iOS, or choose “Ask App Not to Track” on first launch.

### 2. How We Use Your Data
* No data is sold to third parties.  
* Ads are delivered by **Google AdMob**. When tracking is denied, we serve non-personalised ads only.  
* Raw location data is stored for **48 hours**, then aggregated & deleted.

### 3. Your Choices
* **Opt-out of tracking** – see iOS Settings above.  
* **Delete your account & data** – e-mail us at **privacy@sgjbjam.app**; we’ll erase your UID & forum posts within 7 days.
